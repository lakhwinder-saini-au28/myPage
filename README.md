# myPage
This in my very first publishing on github pages and I hope that it will work as intended. By doing this I will be able to show my site to my friends and relatives which will be very cool for them. I've created a simple page by using just plain html and there is no CSS in it. As I am learning the process I will incremently update my website and then it will look even better.
